- https://hyd.ifu.ethz.ch/research/riparian/susp-sed-sense.html

This repo contains several items to build the current prototype of the open-source turbidity sensor including:
- The code needed to upload to the ESP32
- CAD files
- Hookup schematics

## Code
Before you begin, you need the ESP-IDF installed on your computer. Please visit the [Espressif website](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/) for more information on installation.
